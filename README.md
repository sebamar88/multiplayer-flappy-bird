# Multiplayer Flappy Birds
 
 This project implements a multiplayer version of the classic game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). 
 
 It implements the client/server communication strategy for the game which works over WebSockets using [Ably's](https://www.ably.io) realtime messaging infrastructure.
 
 This project is part of a video walk-through which is [available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ReGHyTh1ydU).
